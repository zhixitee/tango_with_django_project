## Feature Request

**The feature, motivation, and pitch**  
A clear and concise description of the feature proposal. Please outline the motivation for the proposal. Is your feature request related to a specific problem? For example, TitanML's inference stack "Takeoff" is unable to process large batch sizes due to memory constraints, resulting in error X. If this is related to another GitHub issue, please link it here too.

**If you have, please provide a suggestion or alternatives**  
A description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. If any.

**Feature Request Type**
- Core functionality
  - Example: Improve memory management for larger batch sizes.
  - Example: Enhance model loading for faster startup.
