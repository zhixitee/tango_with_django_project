## Usability Improvement Suggestion

**Describe the usability issue or area for improvement**  
A clear and concise description of what the usability issue is or what aspect of the user experience could be improved. For example, the model loading process in TitanML's "Takeoff" is unintuitive for new users.

**Proposed solution**  
Please describe your suggested improvement:
1. Implement a step-by-step wizard for model loading
2. Add progress bars for each stage of the loading process
3. Provide clearer error messages for common issues

- **User persona affected:**
  - Describe the type of user who would benefit most from this improvement (e.g., ML engineers new to large language models)
- **Use case:**
  - Describe the specific use case this improvement addresses (e.g., First-time setup of a new model for inference)

**Current workflow**  
Describe the current process that could be improved:
1. Go to 'Model Management'
2. Click on 'Load Model'
3. Input model parameters manually
4. Wait for loading with no progress indication

**Expected behaviour after improvement**  
A clear and concise description of how the user experience would be enhanced. For example, users should be guided through the model loading process with clear visual feedback.

**Screenshots or mockups**  
If applicable, add screenshots or mockups to illustrate your suggestion.

**Additional context**  
Add any other context about the usability improvement here. For example, similar features in competing products or relevant UX research.
